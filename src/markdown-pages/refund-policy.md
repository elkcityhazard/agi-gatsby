**Absolutely Gorgeous Interiors**

**REFUND POLICY**

You can request a refund for nearly any unused service / purchase. Absolutely Gorgeous Interiors will, upon request via mark@agitraversebay.com, issue a refund for any reason, if the request is made within 7 days of purchase, and the service / product has not been used. There are more details below, but even if you fall outside of the refund rules we’ve described, you can ask for a refund anyway and we will take a look.

You will be issued a full refund of your purchase within a week of approval. You will receive the refund through the same payment method you used to make the purchase. If for any reason, Absolutely Gorgeous Interiors is unable to issue a refund via your initial payment method, we will provide the value in equivalent credit or provide an alternate method of refund. (Some payment methods available in your jurisdiction may not support refunding a purchase back to the original payment method.)

**Where Refunds Apply**

Our refund offer, within 7 days of purchase and has not been used, applies to products and services on our website.  This does not apply to construction, design, remodeling, consulting services.  Refunds are limited to retail products that are purchased at https://www.agitraversebay.com

**EU Right of Withdrawal Services**

European law principally provides a right of withdrawal on software sales. However, it can be and typically is excluded for boxed software that has been opened and for digitally provided content once it has been made available to the end user. This is what happens when you make a transaction: The EU statutory right of withdrawal ends the moment the content and services are added to your account.

**For any EU consumer:**

You have the right to withdraw from any purchase of unused product / service on Absolutely Gorgeous Interiors within 14 days without giving any reason.

For any purchase products, the withdrawal period will expire after 14 days from the day on which you acquire, or a third party other than the carrier and indicated by you acquires, physical possession of the goods ("Hardware Return Period"). For any transaction related to digital content, the withdrawal period will end when the content is made available to you with your prior express consent and acknowledgement that you lose your right of withdrawal.

To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us of your decision to withdraw from the purchase contract by an unequivocal statement. The easiest way to do so is by informing our customer support through mark@agitraversebay.com. If you do so, we will communicate to you an acknowledgement of receipt of such a withdrawal on a durable medium (e.g. by e-mail) without delay. To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.

**Effects of withdrawal**

If you withdraw from an agreement, we shall reimburse you all payments received from you, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this contract. We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement. We may withhold reimbursement until we have received the goods back or you have supplied evidence of having sent back the goods, whichever is the earliest.

You shall send back the goods to our returns warehouse without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which you communicate your withdrawal from this contract to us. The deadline is met if you send back the goods before the period of 14 days has expired. You will have to bear the direct cost of returning the goods. You are only liable for any diminished value of the goods resulting from the handling other than what is necessary to establish the nature, characteristics, and functioning of the goods. If the product you wish to return was bundled with a Subscription, the Subscription is automatically cancelled with your return of the product.

**Abuse**

Refunds are designed to remove the risk from purchasing products or services — not as a way to get free products and services. If it appears to us that you are abusing refunds, we may stop offering them to you. We do not consider it abuse to request a refund on a title that was purchased just before a sale and then immediately rebuying that title for the sale price.
