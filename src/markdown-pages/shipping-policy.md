We charge per N/A published rates.

Note: We reserve the right to adjust the shipping charge if the actual rate comes back higher than originally calculated due to the dim weight of the package.

**What is covered in the FREE SHIPPING?**

Free shipping is only available for domestic orders and only for regularly priced items, subject to promotions.

**How much do you charge for shipping and handling?**

You may check an estimate of the shipping charges by adding an item to the shopping cart and entering your shipping zip code or location.

**My package has been shipped but they have not delivered it yet. Why?**

Please contact the shipper to obtain further status on your packages. The priority of delivery within the method of shipment chosen is determined by your shipper. Absolutely Gorgeous Interiors would always like for your packages to be delivered ASAP. If the shipper is holding them, please contact them.

Check the amount of tracking numbers you should have received. Verify you have received all boxes and checked all packing material for small items. If you are still missing an item(s), contact our customer service at Absolutely Gorgeous Interiors.

**Are shipping costs added cumulatively for each item I order or do they reduce when multiple items are purchased?**

When you order multiple items, most of the time the shipping is reduced in your shopping cart depending on weight and size, safety, and insurance required. You will see the reduction if it applies to your region.
